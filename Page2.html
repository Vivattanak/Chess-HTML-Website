                <p>
                    <strong>Chess notation</strong> is the standard method for recording chess moves, detailing the move number, the piece moved, and its destination square.
                    Each square on the board is denoted by a letter and a number representing the file and rank, respectively. Pieces are abbreviated with
                    capital letters: <b>"K"</b> for king, <b>"Q"</b> for queen, <b>"R"</b> for rook, <b>"B"</b> for bishop, and <b>"N"</b> for knight. Pawns are not abbreviated. Captures are
                    indicated by <b>"x"</b>, while short castling is noted as <b>0-0</b> and long castling as <b>0-0-0</b>. Notations like <b>1-0</b> signify White's victory, <b>0-1</b> denotes
                    Black's win, and <b>1/2-1/2</b> indicates a draw.

            The game of chess is usually divided into 3 stages which is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The opening:</b> This represents the beginning of the game, in which players move pieces according to theory(moves that have already been played
            before)that aim to gain an advantage, by getting better positioning, tactic, space, etc. Some examples of chess opening include things like
            the Ruy Lopez, Italian Game, Gambits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The middle game:</b> This is the part of the game where players finish setting up their defenses and attacks and now trying to
            create chances. Through things like tactics, captures, or threat players will be able to gain an advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The end game:</b> The final part of the game, where pieces have been traded and captured. In this part, it usually requires a lot
            of precision, as one wrong move leads you to lose the game.

        </p>

        <h2 id="advtactics">Advance tactics and strategies</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you understand the game on a deeper level, let&lsquo;s talk about some basic tactics which can help you gain an advantage.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>The Pin:</b> Pins happen when a piece attacks an opponent's piece aligned with another more valuable piece or critical square. The
                attacked piece is then <b>"pinned"</b> to the board since moving it would cause the attacked player to suffer a significant loss.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Skewers:</b> Skewers are like backward pins. They happen when a piece attacks a more valuable piece aligned with a weaker piece. The more valuable
                piece has to move and allow the attacker to capture the piece behind it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Fork:</b> Forks happen when a single piece attacks two or more pieces simultaneously with no way for at least one of them to
                escape. Knights are especially useful for forking because of their unique movements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Discovered Attacks:</b>  A discovered attack happens when a player moves a piece out of another piece's way to create an attack. If
                the uncovered piece attacks the enemy king, it is a discovered check.
            </li>
        </ul>
