                    But if you preferred to read, here is a short explanation of the game:

                    each player either has the black pieces or the white pieces, the player with the white pieces goes first.

                    <li>
                        <h3>Pawn</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moves forward one square, but on its first move, it has the option to move two squares forward.</li>
                            <li>Captures diagonally forward.</li>
                            <li>Can be promoted to any other piece (except another pawn) upon reaching the opponent's back rank (final square).</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Special Rule:</b> En passant, is a move where if the opponent’s pawn moves 2 squares forward landing next to your pawn,
                                you can directly capture it as if it only moves one square.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Knight</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically) and then one square perpendicular to that direction.</li>
                            <li>Can jump over other pieces.</li>
                            <li>Captures by landing on the square occupied by an opponent's piece.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Bishop</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moves diagonally any number of squares. </li>
                            <li>Cannot jump over other pieces. </li>
                            <li>Captures by landing on the square occupied by an opponent's piece.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Rook</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares. </li>
                            <li>Cannot jump over other pieces. </li>
                            <li>Captures by landing on the square occupied by an opponent's piece. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Queen</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Combines the moves of a rook and a bishop: can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares. </li>
                            <li>Cannot jump over other pieces. </li>
                            <li>Captures by landing on the square occupied by an opponent's piece. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>King</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moves one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. </li>
                            <li>Cannot move into or remain in check (threatened by the opponent's pieces). </li>
                            <li>Captures by landing on the square occupied by an opponent's piece.</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Special rule:</b> There is a special move, if your king hasn’t moved yet you can team up with the rook and move directly
                                2 squares either to the left or right, and you can move your rook directly next to the king in the opposite direction
                                of where the king moves.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You can only move one piece a turn, after which it would switch to your opponent’s turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When one of your pieces is attacking the opponent’s king, that is called a <b>“check”</b>. If you are in check, you need to protect
                    your king at all costs, whether by moving it, taking the piece that threatens your king, or blocking. However, if the attack
                    is unstoppable, and the opponent’s king is guaranteed to be taken the following turn, that is called a <b>“checkmate”</b    >, and you would
                    directly win.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is basically the basics and bare rules, so go and play chess!
